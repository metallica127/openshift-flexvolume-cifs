# openshift-flexvolume-cifs

FlexVolume driver for access CIFS based shares

## Overview

[FlexVolume's](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_flex_volume.html) provide a method for users to create their own drivers for adding options for utilizng persistent storage in an OpenShift and Kubernetes environment. This driver allows for the creation of a [PersistentVolume](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html) or direct mount to access storage that is exposed by a CIFS share.

## Setup

Utilize either one of the following methods to configure FlexVolume support in your environment

### Manual setup

Installation and configuration of the CIFS FlexVolume driver can be completed manually or in an automated fashion using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). 

1. Install required packages

```
yum install cifs-utils
```

2. Install the driver

The [cifs](flexvolume-driver/cifs) driver needs to be placed on all nodes that applications leveraging the FlexVolume driver will be mounted. The drivers that are used to support FlexVolume's are placed within the `/usr/libexec/kubernetes/kubelet-plugins/volume/exec/` directory. Within this directory, drivers are stored by vendor name and driver name in the format `<vendor>~<driver>`. Tehe vendor for this driver is `openshift.io` and the driver name is called `cifs`. Create a directory called `/usr/libexec/kubernetes/kubelet-plugins/volume/exec/openshift.io~cifs` and place the cifs driver executable within it

3. Restart the OpenShift Services

On all nodes the driver was configured on, restart the Atomic Node service

```
systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
```

### Ansible based environment setup

The installation process for the FlexVolume driver can be automated through the use of an Ansible playbook located in the [ansible](ansible) directory.

### Configure the inventory

An example inventory file called [inventory](ansible/inventory) is available in the [ansible](ansible) directory. The inventory groups align with the group names utilized in the OpenShift installation meaning that inventories created for existing environments can be utilized. Otherwise, fill out the _nodes_ group with the instances that are desired to be configured with the CIFS FlexVolume driver.

### Run the playbook

Run the Ansible playbook executing the following command within the [ansible](ansible) directory.

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory setup-openshift.yml
```

## Implementation

The following steps will not only walk through some of the available options provided by the CIFS driver, but showcase how one can utilize it in your environment.

### Secrets

In many cases, access to CIFS shares will be protected and require authentication. Credentials to access CIFS volumes can be placed in a secret and then referenced in the FlexVolume definition. 

A secret can either be manually created or an OpenShift template can be processed to create a secret. 

To manually create the required secret, create a file called `flexvolume-cifs-secret.yml` with the following contents

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cifs-credentials
type: openshift.io/cifs
stringData:
  username: <username>
  password: <password>
```

Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with the actual values

Create or utilize an existing namespace and apply the previously created secret file

```
oc apply -f secret.yml
```

Instead of manually creating a secret file and then applying it to the cluster, an existing template file called [credentials-secret-template.yml](examples/cifs-secret-template.yml) can be utilized from the examples folder.

The template requires that a username and password be provided as parameters. 

Execute the following command to instantiate the template

```
oc process -p USERNAME=<username> -p PASSWORD=<password> -f examples/cifs-secret-template.yml | oc apply -f-
```

A new secret called _cifs-credentials_ will be created

_NOTE_: In addition to username and password, the domain associated with the CIFS share can also be specified. If desired, add the `domain` key to the secret.

A _credentials_ file will be located one directory above the location where the volume is mounted in the format `.<MOUNT_NAME>.credentials

### Security Context Contraints

By default, all pods created by typical end users make use of the _restricted_ [Security Context Constraint](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/admin_guide/manage_scc.html). FlexVolumes are not one of the allowed volume types. Instead of modifying the existing _restricted_ SCC, it is recommended that a custom SCC be created instead. An example of an SCC based upon the restricted SCC with support for FlexVolume's is provided in the examples folder called [restricted-flexvolume-scc.yml](examples/restricted-flexvolume-scc.yml).

As a cluster administrator, apply the SCC to the cluster.

```
oc apply -f examples/restricted-flexvolume-scc.yml
```

With the SCC in place, grant the service account that will be used by applications access to the newly created SCC. The following example describes how to grant the _default_ service account to the custom SCC.

```
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user restricted-flexvolume -z default
```

### FlexVolume Definition

As previously described, FlexVolume definitions can be placed either on a PersistentVolume or directly on the object. An example is defined below:

```
flexVolume:
  driver: openshift.io/cifs
  fsType: cifs
  options:
    mountOptions: 'file_mode=0770,dir_mode=0770'
    networkPath: //cifsserver/cifsShare
  secretRef:
    name: cifs-credentials
  name: cifs
```

Be sure to configure the `networkPath` option with the location of the CIFS sahre. In addition, it is recommended (almost required) that the above `mountOptions` be specified in order to comply with OpenShift's security model.

_Note_: The security context mount option `context=system_u:object_r:svirt_sandbox_file_t:s0` is used by default in order to grant containers access to the file system the share is mounted on where SELinux is enabled. You may override this with a different context, however it is no recommended.

## Existing Implementations

The contents of this repository are not the first attempt at a CIFS FlexVolume driver. However, due to the combination of OpenShift's security requirements, as well as the architecture of the _controller-manager_, it became necessary for another implementation to be created. Many thanks are due to the following implementations:

* [fstab/cifs](https://github.com/fstab/cifs)
* [Azure CIFS/SMB FlexDriver for Kubernetes](https://github.com/Azure/kubernetes-volume-drivers)
